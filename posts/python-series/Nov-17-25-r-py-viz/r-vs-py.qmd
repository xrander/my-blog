I started learning Python for about 3 months now, and without going too long into visualization with python I say R is better for visualization not because Python is bad, but because most popular visualization packages such as matplotlib and seaborn shows large inconsistency, and not straight forward to use. While seaborn, is a good package and is more intuitive compared to matplotlib.
