## Introduction
According to the World Bank, Algeria's forest is about 0.82% of the total country's land mass in 2021 ([tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/algeria/forest-area-percent-of-land-area-wb-data.html)). Algeria is one of the Maghreb countries affected by wildfire. Given the troubles associated with wildfire, it is important to assess and predict the potential for wildfire activity. One of the ways to predict the potential for wildfire is associating its occurrence with weather conditions. This is called the **Fire Weather Index** (FWI). FWI was developed by the Canadian Forest Service and it is a key component of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System. FWI is also used internationally to assess fire danger and predict wildfire behavior based on weather conditions.

### Objective
For this project, we will predict the occurrence of fire given a set of parameters related to FWI in two regions of Algeria, the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.
